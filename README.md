## Predicting Signups
Sometimes when a high-traffic site links to a new application that offers free accounts and subscription accounts, the application will get thousands of new users. Many of these users are driven by curiosity and are not really looking for that particular type of application, so there is a low likelihood that they will become paying customers. This makes it difficult to distinguish and follow up with likely customers, so many sites report to mass-emailing everyone who has signed up, rather than using a more targeted approach. 
To help with this problem, it would be useful to be able to predict the likelihood that a user will become a paying customer, and the factors that indicate if a user will become a customer. The former information can be used to guide an advertisement strategy and to make certain aspects of the site more accessible.
